## 51mayday's Scarpet Scripts for Storage Tech
Various scarpet scripts (requires carpet mod) for testing contraptions, setting up inventories, or collecting data. Particular focus on storage tech applications. 

Use at your own risk and please let me know if you encounter any issues.

Sometimes help can be found in the comments at the top of each file.

### Legacy
Previous versions of current scripts, preserved if I still have test setups that use them or if they offer separate functionality no longer supported.

### Dev
Work-in-progress scripts, hosted so that others can test them and offer feedback. These scripts may not have been tested thoroughly. 

### Advanced
Versions of scripts with feature sets that are useful only in extremely specific scenarios. Your mileage may vary - scripts here were likely used once by Ners and then ignored.
